 * WolnoÅ›ciowiec / WebDeploy
 * ------------------------
 *
 *   Framework for creation of post-install scripts dedicated
 *   for applications hosted on shared hosting (without access to the shell).
 *
 *   A part of an anarchist portal - wolnosciowiec.net
 *
 *   WolnoÅ›ciowiec is a project to integrate the movement
 *   of people who strive to build a society based on
 *   solidarity, freedom, equality with a respect for
 *   individual and cooperation of each other.
 *
 *   We support human rights, animal rights, feminism,
 *   anti-capitalism (taking over the production by workers),
 *   anti-racism, and internationalism. We negate
 *   the political fight and politicians at all.
